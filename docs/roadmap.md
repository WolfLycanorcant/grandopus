### **3.2 API Endpoints (Backend)**  
| **Endpoint**               | **Method** | **Description**                          |  
|----------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------|

| `/api/battle/simulate`     | POST       | Runs combat simulation between squads.  |  

---

### **3.3 NVIDIA GPU Integration**  
- **WebGL Extensions:**  
  - Use `WEBGL_lose_context` for fallback handling.  
  - `OES_texture_float` for high-precision rendering.  
- **CUDA via WebAssembly:**  
  - Offload damage calculations to GPU using `GPU.js` or `Fugue`.  

---

## **4. QA & Testing**  
### **4.1 Automated Testing**  
- **Unit Tests:**  
  - Combat formula validation (e.g., `calculate_damage` returns expected values).  
  - Squad size calculation edge cases (e.g., 12 units + 2 beasts = 14 slots â†’ capped at 12).  
- **Integration Tests:**  
  - Squad editor UI updates state correctly.  
  - Battle log accurately reflects attack results.  

### **4.2 Performance Testing**  
- **GPU Load:**  
  - Measure FPS with 12 units on screen (target: â‰¥60 FPS on NVIDIA GTX 1060).  
- **Memory:**  
  - Profile texture/asset usage (keep under 2GB VRAM).  

---

## **5. Post-Launch**  
- **Content Updates:**  
  - New races (e.g., undead), siege equipment, and skill nodes.  
- **Mod Support:**  
  - JSON schema for custom units/weapons.  

--- 

**Final Note:** Prioritize modularity (e.g., decouple battle logic from UI) to simplify scaling. Use `git` branches for parallel development (e.g., `feature/skill-trees`, `bugfix/formation-bugs`).
