## **3. Technical Details**  
### **3.1 Data Structures**  
#### **Unit**  
```typescript
interface Unit {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  race: "human" | "elf" | "dwarf" | "beast" | ...;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    str: number;
    mag: number;
    skl: number;
    arm: number;
    ldr: number;
  };
  proficiencies: { [weaponType: string]: number };
  equipment: {
    weapon?: Weapon;
    armor?: Armor;
    // ... other slots
  };
  skills: string[]; // Unlocked skill IDs
}
```  

#### **Squad**  
```typescript
interface Squad {
  id: string;
  units: Unit[];
  formation: { [position: string]: string }; // e.g., "row-0-col-0": "unit-1"
  artifacts: Artifact[];
  drills: string[]; // e.g., ["phalanx", "arcane_resonance"]
}
```

#### **Achievement System**
```typescript
interface Achievement {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: 'combat' | 'support' | 'mastery' | 'legendary';
  requirement: {
    type: 'damage_taken' | 'healing_done' | 'kills' | 'battles_won' | ...;
    target: number;

    totalHealingDone: number;
    totalKills: number;
    battlesWon: number;
    criticalHits: number;
    unitsHealed: Set<string>;
    // ... other tracked stats
  };
}
```

### **3.2 API Endpoints (Backend)**  
| **Endpoint**               | **Method** | **Description**                          |  
|----------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------|  
| `/api/squad/<id>/stats`    | GET        | Returns squad stats (total damage, HP). |  
| `/api/equipment/embed`     | POST       | Embeds an ember into a weapon.          |  
| `/api/battle/simulate`     | POST       | Runs combat simulation between squads.  |  

---

### **3.3 NVIDIA GPU Integration**  
- **WebGL Extensions:**  
  - Use `WEBGL_lose_context` for fallback handling.  
  - `OES_texture_float` for high-precision rendering.  
- **CUDA via WebAssembly:**  
  - Offload damage calculations to GPU using `GPU.js` or `Fugue`.  

---

## **4. QA & Testing**  
### **4.1 Automated Testing**  
- **Unit Tests:**  
  - Combat formula validation (e.g., `calculate_damage` returns expected values).  
  - Squad size calculation edge cases (e.g., 12 units + 2 beasts = 14 slots â†’ capped at 12).  
- **Integration Tests:**  
  - Squad editor UI updates state correctly.  
  - Battle log accurately reflects attack results.  

### **4.2 Performance Testing**  
- **GPU Load:**  
  - Measure FPS with 12 units on screen (target: â‰¥60 FPS on NVIDIA GTX 1060).  
- **Memory:**  
  - Profile texture/asset usage (keep under 2GB VRAM).  

---

## **5. Post-Launch**  
- **Content Updates:**  
  - New races (e.g., undead), siege equipment, and skill nodes.  
- **Mod Support:**  
  - JSON schema for custom units/weapons.  

--- 

**Final Note:** Prioritize modularity (e.g., decouple battle logic from UI) to simplify scaling. Use `git` branches for parallel development (e.g., `feature/skill-trees`, `bugfix/formation-bugs`).
