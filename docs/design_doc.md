  1. Attacking squad‚Äôs units attack (front row first).  
  2. Defending squad counterattacks.  
  3. Repeat until one squad is wiped.  

- **Damage Formula:**  
  ```python  
  damage = weapon.base_damage  
           * (1 + proficiency/100)  
           * stat_modifier (STR/MAG)  
           * ember/artifact_modifiers
