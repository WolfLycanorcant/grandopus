Here‚Äôs a consolidated breakdown of **all game features** discussed so far, organized for clarity:

---

### **Core Game Concept**  
A **deeply customizable squad-based tactical war game** where players:  
- Build squads of **up to 12 units** (scaling with leadership, game progress, and unit size).  
- Tweak stats, weapons, equipment, and artifacts.  
- Strategize with **formation-based combat** (front/back row advantages).  
- Manage a **strategic overworld** with terrain, buildings, and resources.

- **Core Stats:**  
  - **HP, Strength (STR), Magic (MAG), Skill (SKL), Armor (ARM), Leadership (LDR)**.

#### **2. Squad System**  
- **Max Squad Size:**  
  - Starts small (3‚Äì6 units) and scales to **12 units** based on:
